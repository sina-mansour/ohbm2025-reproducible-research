# ðŸ“˜ Building Reproducible Analysis Pipelines

This chapter aims to set the foundation for how to achieve analytical reproducibility, especially via **good coding practices**, **structured workflows**, and **tools** tailored for neuroimaging.

**Key goals of this chapter:**

- Show that reproducibility starts with how we write, document, and share code.
- Emphasize modular, readable, and shareable analysis pipelines.
- Provide examples on how to implement best practices in sharing code.
- Introduce relevant tools that can help you in sharing your analysis code.
