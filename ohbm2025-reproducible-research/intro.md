## 💬 Synopsis

How can neuroimaging researchers ensure their findings are not only robust but also **transparent** and **reproducible**?

This book guides you through building research workflows with reproducible **code** and **visualizations**, designed to accompany your manuscript and support open science.

### 🧠 Why Reproducibility?
Reproducibility helps:
- ✅ Maximize trust in your work
- 🤝 Enable collaboration across teams
- 🔍 Improve transparency and accountability

---

We provide examples and practical tips to boost reproducibility:

#### 💻 In your Code:

- 📝 Write clear, shareable scripts
- 🌟 Follow best practices for sharing code
- 🌐 Use open notebooks for full pipeline visibility

#### 🎨 In your Visualizations:

- 🖼️ Understand why reproducible figures matter
- 🔁 Learn how to make visualizations easy to recreate
- 🛠️ Build scriptable visualizations for:
  - 🧠 Cortical surface projections
  - 🧊 Volumetric plots
  - 〰️🧵 Tractography results
  - 🕸️ Brain network diagrams
  - ... & more!
